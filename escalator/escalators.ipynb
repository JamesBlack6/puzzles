    "# Is Tokyo Right About How To Use Escalators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the article [Tokyo Wants People to Stand on Both Sides of the Escalator](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/12/people-stand-walk-escalator-left-right-save-time-efficient/578479/), let's examine two different ways of using an escalator that can accomodate two people per step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is people always stand, which is what railway officials in Tokyo want people to do. The second is people who want to stand stick to one side, leaving the other side free for those who wish to walk, which is how they're typically been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at several different metrics - the average amount of time people wait to actually get on the escalator, the number of people processed per second and the average amount of time people people spend in total waiting for and actually on the escalator."

The time spent in the queue and on the escalator is then $$T_E = t_Q + \\frac{L}{s}$$ for those standing and $$T_E = t_Q + \\frac{L}{w+s}$$ for those walking, where $w$ is the walking speed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that expected queue waiting time will always be minimized with a standing only (M/D/2) approach, as will the number people processed per second. However, under some very reasonable assumptions it's very likely that the expected amount of time spent waiting for and actually on the escalator will be smaller with the walk/stand (dual M/D/1) approach, as the walkers will spend far less time actually on the escalator. Of course, there may be other reasons to prefer people to stand only, e.g. safety. However, this suggests instead designing escalators so that they're easier and safer to climb rather than requiring everyone stand."
